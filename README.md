# CV Generator

A CV engine made so it would be easier to change between different cv versions, separating the data and the presentation    

## Improvements

There's still a lot of room form improvements, the first things that could be improved are:

1. Put each sections of the cv on directive so it would be easier to change the place where there are shown.
2. Be able to edit the information on site and see how it would look without the need to refresh or load the JSON.
3. Be able to copy paste a JSON file with the correct structure and see how it renders.
4. Create more templates so one can choose the style that suite one personality or purpose.
5. Better naming convention.
